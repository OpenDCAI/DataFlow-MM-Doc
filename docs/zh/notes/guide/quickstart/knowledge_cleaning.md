# 批量知识库清洗

## 第一步:安装dataflow环境

​	从源码安装：

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow.git
cd DataFlow
pip install -e .
pip install -e .[mineru]
mineru-models-download
```

​	从PyPi安装：

```shell
pip install open-dataflow
pip install open-dataflow[mineru]
mineru-models-download
```



## 第二步:创建新的dataflow工作文件夹

```shell
mkdir run_dataflow
cd run_dataflow
```

## 第三步:初始化Dataflow

```shell
dataflow init
```

​	进入脚本目录：

```shell
cd gpu_pipelines/kbcleaning
```

## 第四步:一键运行

```bash
python kbcleaning_pipeline_batch_sglang.py 
```
[code](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow/blob/main/dataflow/statics/pipelines/gpu_pipelines/kbcleaning/kbcleaning_pipeline_batch_sglang.py)

运行时，该流水线会先后调用：

1. FileOrURLToMarkdownConverter  把原始文件/URL提取成Markdown
2. KBCChunkGenerator  将文本分段
3. KBCTextCleaner  针对分段文本做全面清洗
4. KBCMultiHopQAGenerator  基于清洗后知识合成QA数据

对于算子的具体功能介绍可以参考"知识库清洗和QA合成"部分，此处调用后会在`.cache 目录下`中生成一个json文件，文件内容如下文所示。

> Demo中只提供了两个Source用于功能展示。除此之外，Dataflow还为用户提供了一千篇Arxiv论文供用户测试功能。论文的主题包括LLM，数据库等。数据集链接：[Open-Dataflow/1k_arxiv · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Dataflow/1k_arxiv) 您可以下载后将数据集整理成如下格式：
>
> ```jsonl
> {"raw_content": "path/to/first.pdf"}
> {"raw_content": "path/to/second.pdf"}
> ...
> ```
>
> 或者您可以直接把**论文对应的URL**整理成如下格式：
> ```jsonl
> {"raw_content": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07773"}
> {"raw_content": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09516"}
> ...
> ```
>
> 并通过下面方式配置您的路径文件/path/to/all_pdf.jsonl，即可实现大批量清洗知识库。
>
>
> ```python
> self.storage = FileStorage(
>     first_entry_file_name="/path/to/all_pdf.jsonl",
>     cache_path="./.cache/gpu",
>     file_name_prefix="batch_cleaning_step",
>     cache_type="json"
> )
> ```

## 合成数据示例

```json
[
  {
    "raw_content":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/bitter_lesson.pdf",
    "text_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/bitter_lesson.md",
    "chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/extract\/bitter_lesson_chunk.json",
    "cleaned_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/extract\/bitter_lesson_chunk.json",
    "enhanced_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/extract\/bitter_lesson_chunk.json"
  },
  {
    "raw_content":"https:\/\/trafilatura.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/quickstart.html",
    "text_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/crawled_2.md",
    "chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/extract\/crawled_2_chunk.json",
    "cleaned_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/extract\/crawled_2_chunk.json",
    "enhanced_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/extract\/crawled_2_chunk.json"
  }
]
```

每个路径代表某个阶段，对"raw_content"指代的知识库清洗的结果。某个文件最终呈现的状态如下所示（片段）：
