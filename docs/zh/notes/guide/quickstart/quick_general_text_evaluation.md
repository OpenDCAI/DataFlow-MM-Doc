# 快速开始: 简易数据质量评估

本案例展示如何使用DataFlow中GeneralText部分的算子进行快速质量评估。

## 1. 安装DataFlow环境
请通过如下命令安装DataFlow所需环境依赖。
```bash
pip install open-dataflow
```

## 2. 创建DataFlow工作区
用户可以在本地创建一个用于DataFlow快速运行的文件夹作为工作区。下面的指令提供了一个例子：
```bash
mkdir run_dataflow
cd run_dataflow
```

### 3. 初始化DataFlow
创建并切换当前文件夹到工作区后，用户可以一键初始化DataFlow的quick start运行代码
```bash
dataflow init
```
这时你会看到文件夹中出现了一系列测试代码及文件。
```bash
run_dataflow/playground/quick_evaluate.py
```

## 4. 配置LLM Serving
本案例所需算子需要基于API的LLM Serving，所以在运行之前需要把API key写入到环境变量中。
对于Linux和Mac OS系统
```bash
export DF_API_KEY="sk-xxxxx"
```
对于Windows系统
```bash
$env:DF_API_KEY = "sk-xxxxxx"
```
后续在代码中会通过环境变量读取该 API Key，无需在脚本中明文填写。

另外，api_url也需要在`run_dataflow/playground/quick_and_evaluate.py`中以如下方式填写：
```python
self.llm_serving = APILLMServing_request(
        api_url="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        model_name="gpt-4o",
        max_workers=100
)
```
## 5. 一键运行

```bash
python quick_evaluate.py
```
运行后，该流水线会调用`MetaScorer`，进行基于预指定维度的多维数据评估。

### 关键参数说明

- `MetaScorer.dimensions`需要评估的维度列表，其中每种维度对应一个字典，关键字有
    * `dimension_name`: 维度名称
    * `description`: 维度的具体描述
    * `example_list`: 示例列表，其中每个示例都遵循类似于`{"text": "some text", "score": 1}`的字典格式。

下面是示例流水线中用到的维度列表，位于[dataflow/operators/eval/GeneralText/APIcaller/meta_scorer.py](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow/blob/main/dataflow/operators/eval/GeneralText/APIcaller/meta_scorer.py)中：

### 输出
运行脚本执行完毕后，可在工作区的`playground/cache/`文件夹下观察到脚本的运行结果，下面是示例数据中的一个例子

It passes through some of Switzerland\u2019s most picturesque landscapes and is available for travel in both winter and summer. A train ride through the Swiss Alps is beautiful at any time of the year.\nItalian high-speed trains are booked and have dynamic prices, cheaper in advance than on the day. The reservation opens up to 4 months in advance, depending on the train. Normally, you will need to change trains at least once if you want to travel from Chur to Tirano on these regular local trains.\nAt its highest point, the train is 7392 feet above sea level. You can also book your one-way trip with the Bernina Express and then use the regional trains to reach your next destinations, which would be included in your Swiss Travel Pass. I would also suggest doing this if you plan to get on and off the train. You will have to pay for seats again to return to one of the normal trains, as your tickets will only apply to the panoramic train. It seems that the windows of the normal wagons of the regional train open, but from what I could see, I could not reach those cars from where I was sitting. You can also stop at one of the small towns along the way to get a closer look.\nIn less than four hours, you\u2019ll experience the historic mountain passes of Albula and Bernina, the famous Landwasser Viaduct, with endless views on either side of the train as you twist and turn through the landscape. The 6 limestone arches with the red train, which travel through them, are iconic and became a symbol of scenic train rides in Switzerland and Europe. Shortly after leaving Tirano, the Bernina Express begins to drive through the streets while cars stay at traffic lights, allowing it to pass. The train then climbs up the valley just outside Tirano and continues all the way to the mountainside thousands of meters above sea level. Ospizio Bernina is the summit and highest point of the route at 2,253 meters above sea level.\nTravel with the Bernina Express can also be booked to/from Chur. This sensational scenic drive takes you along some of Switzerland\u2019s most beautiful routes, such as the Golden Pass, Glacier Express, and Bernina Express. In Interlaken you travel to the top of Europe: the Jungfraujoch. Day 2, travel from Zurich to Chur by Swiss InterCity train, then from Chur to Tirano on the fantastic Bernina Express, then Tirano to Milan by regional train trenord, as seen in the previous schedule. You can use the morning train all year round or the evening train in summer. This is the 3-car Allegra unit, coupled with the panoramic cars of the Bernina Express.\nThis is a regional ticket with a fixed price, tickets cannot be sold out, the reservation is not necessary or possible, so you can safely buy close to the departure date, without having to commit your money in advance. In fact, tickets can be purchased at the station on the day itself at this price if you wish. You can avoid paying a reservation fee if you travel in the non-reserved seats on the Allegra unit with the Bernina Express. Since the whole trip only takes 4 hours, you can easily do it in one day.\nThe Express is an hour and a half by train from Zurich and runs all year round. After a break of a few hours, the train departs from Tirano station, making its way through the Treno rosso del Bernina town of Tirano and back along the same route before arriving back in Chur in the late afternoon. The whole trip takes a whole day to complete and can start at both ends.\n2nd Class1st classSingle travel63101Tour116222Sterreservering+10 CHF+ 10 CHFImportantly, as shown in the table, an additional CHF 10 will be charged for seat reservation. These seat reservations can be booked in advance, we recommend this. Booking fees vary depending on the season you are travelling. If you want to travel on the Bernina Express during the cheapest time of the year, we recommend that you travel from November to January/February. It is recommended to reserve a seat if you are travelling during peak hours or want to guarantee a seat on board the daily express trains. You can reserve your seat at a Swiss train station or online.\nTaxis are also not a viable option, as the journey takes several hours. The best way to get from Milan to St. Moritz is via a combination train and bus, which takes about 4.5 hours when all is said and done. You can take a train from Milano Centrale station to Chiavenna, and then change to bus line 4 to St. Moritz Bahnhof. The bus we were travelling in was bad with a clear mechanical problem from the moment we boarded in Milan.\nThey pride themselves on the Bernina Express going from glacial landscapes to palm-friendly climates within hours. They speak enthusiastically about the 7,638 meter high Bernina Pass. And they can\u2019t help mentioning the line\u2019s impressive tunnels and viaducts. It looks like a beautiful train ride and the photos are spectacular.",
