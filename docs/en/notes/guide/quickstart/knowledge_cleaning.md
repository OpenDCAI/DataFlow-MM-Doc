# Batch Knowledge Base Cleaning

## Step 1: Install the DataFlow environment

From source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow.git
cd DataFlow
pip install -e .
pip install -e .[mineru]
mineru-models-download
````

From PyPi:

```shell
pip install open-dataflow
pip install open-dataflow[mineru]
mineru-models-download
```

## Step 2: Create a new DataFlow working folder

```shell
mkdir run_dataflow
cd run_dataflow
```

## Step 3: Initialize DataFlow

```shell
dataflow init
```

&#x9;Enter the script directory:

```shell
cd gpu_pipelines/kbcleaning
```

## Step 4: One-click execution

```bash
python kbcleaning_pipeline_batch_sglang.py 
```
[code](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow/blob/main/dataflow/statics/pipelines/gpu_pipelines/kbcleaning/kbcleaning_pipeline_batch_sglang.py)

During execution, this pipeline will sequentially call:

1. FileOrURLToMarkdownConverter  Converts original files/URLs into Markdown
2. KBCChunkGenerator  Segments the text into chunks
3. KBCTextCleaner  Performs comprehensive cleaning on the segmented text
4. KBCMultiHopQAGenerator  Synthesizes QA data based on the cleaned knowledge

For detailed descriptions of each operator, refer to the "Knowledge Base Cleaning and QA Generation" section. Once executed, a JSON file will be generated in the `.cache` directory with contents as shown below.

> The demo only provides two sources for functionality demonstration. In addition, Dataflow also offers users 1,000 Arxiv papers for testing the functionality. The topics of the papers include LLM, databases, and more. The dataset link is: [Open-Dataflow/1k\_arxiv · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Dataflow/1k_arxiv). You can download the dataset and organize it into the following format:
>
> ```jsonl
> {"raw_content": "path/to/first.pdf"}
> {"raw_content": "path/to/second.pdf"}
> ...
> ```
>
>
> Or you can just put the URLs of the papers in the JSONL file. For example:
> ```jsonl
> {"raw_content": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07773"}
> {"raw_content": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09516"}
> ...
> ```
>
> Then, configure your path file `/path/to/all_pdf.jsonl` as shown below to enable batch cleaning of the knowledge base.
>
> ```python
> self.storage = FileStorage(
>     first_entry_file_name="/path/to/all_pdf.jsonl",
>     cache_path="./.cache/gpu",
>     file_name_prefix="batch_cleaning_step",
>     cache_type="json"
> )
> ```

## Example of Synthesized Data

```json
[
  {
    "raw_content":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/bitter_lesson.pdf",
    "text_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/bitter_lesson.md",
    "chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/extract\/bitter_lesson_chunk.json",
    "cleaned_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/extract\/bitter_lesson_chunk.json",
    "enhanced_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/mineru\/bitter_lesson\/auto\/extract\/bitter_lesson_chunk.json"
  },
  {
    "raw_content":"https:\/\/trafilatura.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/quickstart.html",
    "text_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/crawled_2.md",
    "chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/extract\/crawled_2_chunk.json",
    "cleaned_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/extract\/crawled_2_chunk.json",
    "enhanced_chunk_path":"..\/example_data\/KBCleaningPipeline\/raw\/crawled\/extract\/crawled_2_chunk.json"
  }
]
```

Each path represents a specific processing stage for the knowledge base referenced by "raw\_content". The final output of a file may look like this (snippet):

Most AI research has been conducted as if computation were constant (in which case 'leveraging human knowledge' would be one of the only ways to improve performance); but—over a slightly longer time than a typical research project—massively more computation inevitably becomes available.\n\n“Seeking an improvement” that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation.
